# Used Car Price Prediction

## Overview
In this project, I developed a machine learning model that predicts the prices of used cars based on various features like make, model, year, mileage, and other specifications. This project showcases how data-driven insights can be leveraged to assist buyers and sellers in making informed decisions in the used car market.

## Key Features
- **Data Processing**: Cleaned and preprocessed a dataset containing thousands of car records.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted and selected important features contributing to price prediction.
- **Model Training**: Implemented multiple regression models, including **Linear Regression**, **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forests** to find the best-performing model.
- **Evaluation**: Used metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **R-squared** to assess model accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Libraries**:
  - `Pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `Scikit-Learn` for model training and evaluation.
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
